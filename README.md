# image-via-wifi-signal
Python code example using the OpenCV library to capture and display an image from a camera connected via Wi-Fi signal
In this example, replace camera_ip with your camera's IP address. This code uses the cv2.VideoCapture function to connect to the camera and capture frames, and then displays the frames using cv2.imshow. The loop continues until the 'q' key is pressed.
